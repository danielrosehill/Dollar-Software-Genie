# The Dollar Software Genie

Generate creative software ideas that cost approximately $1 in API fees to implement using AI code generation tools.

## Features

- Generate random software ideas with a slot machine interface
- Filter ideas by category
- View detailed idea descriptions and features
- Generate complete code implementations
- Copy code to clipboard
- No backend required - runs entirely in the browser

## How It Works

1. Spin the slot machine to generate a random software idea
2. View the idea details and decide if you're interested
3. Generate code for the idea using OpenAI's API
4. Copy the code and implement it yourself

## API Key

You'll need to provide your own OpenAI API key to generate ideas and code. The key is stored locally in your browser and never sent to our servers.
