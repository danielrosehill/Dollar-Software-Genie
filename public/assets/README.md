# Assets Directory

This directory contains assets for The Dollar Software Genie application.

## Required Assets

The following assets should be created and placed in this directory:

1. `favicon.ico` - The favicon for the application
2. `logo192.png` - A 192x192 pixel logo for the application
3. `logo512.png` - A 512x512 pixel logo for the application

You can generate these assets using the genie emoji (ðŸ§ž) or any other design that fits the theme of the application.

The `setup.sh` script includes a simple SVG of the genie emoji that can be converted to the required formats using tools like ImageMagick or online converters.
